# MyHangman
This is a small hangman game I created to start learning Ruby.
If you want to use your own dictionary for the game, just replace "words.txt" with your fileName:
Example: hangman = Hangman.new("words.txt") ==> hangman = Hangman.new("my_file.txt")

The method to print the dictionary was used to test that the file was opened and read in correctly.
You start with 8 guesses, and then are asked whether you want to play again upon winning or losing.
